# Solution for HUB-Security:
* Author: *Hagai Vinik*.

## Intro:
This solution was developed as a Home assignment as discussed.
My mission was to design a system that will be able to 
parse rule files and preform tests on a json file that holds a list of songs, 
and to decide whether a song should be played.


## Instructions:
--
* Project is already compiled on Windows. just run .exe file.
On linux, I recommend opening this project with Clion IDE, 
and just click *build project* button and it should be it.
(though I haven't tried to run my software on Linux)

* solution was developed on Windows 10 64 bit.

* To run solution with different rules, please change constexpr `RULE_PATH` as you wish, compile & run again.

## Libraries that I've used:

* Nlohmann json - included `json.hpp` file.
* CRC++ - included `CRC.h` file.
